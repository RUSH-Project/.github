# Who are we ?
The RUSH project is a major design project involving around twenty engineering students at the University of Sherbrooke. We are a multidisciplinary team in mechanical, robotics, and electrical engineering, passionate about motorsport, eager to push our limits in design and manufacturing. The main objective of this project is to design, manufacture, and optimize a car capable of participating in the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb (PPIHC), one of the most iconic and demanding automobile races in the world.

Everything stored on github regarding our project including code, code documentation, circuits schematics, etc. is open-souce under the MIT license.
